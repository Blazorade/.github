# Blazorade

**Blazorade** is the brand name for a family of libraries and tools aiming to simplify Blazor application development. While Blazorade started of as a set of libraries designed for browser applications, both Blazor server and Blazor WebAssembly, we are gradually moving towards supporting any kind of Blazor application, including desktop and mobile through .NET MAUI Blazor Hybrid applications.

## Blazorade - The Name

The name **Blazorade** is a [blend word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blend_word), a _portmanteau_, built mainly from the following words.
- Blazor - The obvious, since we're completely focusing on Blazor application.
- Aid (ade) - Helping, or aiding, in Blazor application development.
- Parade - Celebrating, or parading, Blazor and Blazor application development.

Some might also find similarities with a certain beverage, implying an energy boost and fuel for Blazor application development.

## Planned Libraries

In addition to the public repositories found in the Blazorade organization on Github, the following libraries are in various early planning or development phases. If you have special interest in any of these, and maybe want to get involved in the development work, please don't hesitate to get in touch. Maybe that's just the nudge we need to get the development work going.
